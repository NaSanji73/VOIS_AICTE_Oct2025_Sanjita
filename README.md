# 🏠 Airbnb Open Data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Airbnb Open Data** to uncover insights about property listings, prices, availability, and geographical patterns.  
It uses **Python** and data visualization libraries like **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly** to analyze and visualize trends effectively.

## 📊 Project Overview

Airbnb datasets provide rich information about listings — including host details, neighborhood information, reviews, and pricing.  
This project focuses on analyzing this data to:

- Understand how pricing varies across locations  
- Identify patterns in host activity and availability  
- Explore relationships between ratings, reviews, and prices  
- Visualize neighborhood-level insights

## 🧠 Objectives

1. Clean and preprocess the Airbnb dataset  
2. Perform detailed EDA using visual and statistical techniques  
3. Identify key factors influencing price and availability  
4. Create visual dashboards for data storytelling
